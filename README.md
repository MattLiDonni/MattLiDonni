Hi, Iâ€™m Matt LiDonni. I'm an NJIT Alumni, I have a Bachelors of Science in Information Technology.

I spend my free time undertaking new projects (not always coding) that drive me to learn new skills and improve myself.

Some of the repositories here are forked from my school account, and it will say in the description or readme file if so.
